Claude Desktop supports MCP servers natively. You can add Caylex as an MCP server in the Claude Desktop configuration file to give Claude access to all your connected tools.

## Configuration

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "caylex": {
          "url": "https://proxy.caylex.ai/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "x-api-key": "ck_abc123.your-secret-key",
            "x-user-email": "you@example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json claude_desktop_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "caylex": {
          "url": "https://proxy.caylex.ai/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "x-api-key": "ck_abc123.your-secret-key",
            "x-user-email": "you@example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Replace `ck_abc123.your-secret-key` with your actual Agent Instance API key and `you@example.com` with your email.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Go to your Agent Instance in the Caylex dashboard and create or copy an API key. See [Agents & Permissions](/platform/agents) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with servers">
    Make sure you have authenticated with the servers in your project via an [Auth Link](/auth/auth-links). Use the same email address you put in the configuration file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the config file">
    Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the Caylex MCP server configuration shown above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Restart Claude Desktop for the configuration to take effect. You should see Caylex listed as an available MCP server.

    <Check>
    Claude Desktop now has access to all tools from your Caylex project. Try asking Claude to interact with one of your connected services.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations

<Note>
Claude Desktop uses a **static configuration** — the `x-user-email` is fixed in the config file. This means:

- The same user credentials are used for all conversations
- You cannot dynamically switch users without editing the config file
- This is best suited for personal use or development/testing

For production applications where you need to support multiple users, use a programmatic integration like the [OpenAI Agents SDK](/integration/openai-agents), [LangChain](/integration/langchain), or [Claude Agent SDK](/integration/claude-sdk) where you can set `x-user-email` dynamically per request.
