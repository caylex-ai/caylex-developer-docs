Servers are the MCP integrations that provide tools to your agents. Caylex supports two ways to add servers: from the **Caylex Catalog** of pre-configured servers, or as **custom servers** that you manage.

## Add a server from the Caylex Catalog

The Caylex Catalog contains pre-configured MCP servers for popular platforms. These servers come with pre-defined endpoints, transport settings, and authentication methods — so you can add them with minimal configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse the catalog">
    Navigate to the **Servers** page and click **Add Server**. Browse the catalog by category or search for a specific platform (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion, Gmail).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a server">
    Click on the server you want to add. Review the server details including available tools, authentication method, and description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your tenant">
    Click **Add Server** to add it to your organization. The server is now available to connect to any of your projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add a custom server

If the server you need is not in the catalog, you can add your own MCP server by providing its connection details.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your auth method">
    Navigate to **Servers** and click **Add Server**, then select **Custom Server**. Choose the authentication method your server uses:

    - **OAuth** — for servers that use OAuth 2.0 (e.g., Google APIs, Microsoft Graph)
    - **Header** — for servers that authenticate via HTTP headers (e.g., API keys, Bearer tokens)
    - **Path** — for servers that embed credentials in the URL path
    - **Query** — for servers that pass credentials as URL query parameters
    - **No Auth** — for servers that do not require authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the server">
    Provide the connection details:

    - **Name** — a unique name for the server
    - **Endpoint URL** — the MCP server's endpoint
    - **Transport type** — Streamable HTTP (recommended) or SSE
    - **Auth configuration** — specific to the auth method you selected (see below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and verify">
    Save the server. Caylex automatically discovers the available tools from the server endpoint and registers them.

    <Check>
    Your custom server appears in the servers list, ready to be connected to projects.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Auth method details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth">
    Provide your OAuth application credentials:
    - **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    - **Authorization URL** and **Token URL**
    - **Scopes** required by your application

    Caylex uses PKCE by default for enhanced security. When users authenticate via an auth link, they go through the standard OAuth flow and Caylex securely manages their tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Header">
    Define the HTTP headers your server requires:
    - **Header name** (e.g., `X-API-Key`, `Authorization`)
    - **Value prefix** (optional, e.g., `Bearer ` for Authorization headers)

    Users provide their header values when authenticating via an auth link. Values are stored securely in AWS Parameter Store.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Path">
    Define the URL path parameters your server requires:
    - Use `<PARAM_NAME>` or `{PARAM_NAME}` placeholders in your endpoint URL
    - List each parameter that users need to provide

    Example endpoint: `https://api.example.com/<workspace_id>/mcp`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Query">
    Define the query parameters your server requires:
    - **Parameter name** (e.g., `api_key`)
    - Users provide parameter values when authenticating

    Values are appended to the endpoint URL at runtime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Auth">
    No authentication configuration needed. The server is accessible without credentials.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connect a server to a project

After adding a server to your organization, connect it to a project to create a **Server Instance**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your project">
    Navigate to the project where you want to add the server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a server instance">
    Click **Add Server** on the project page and select the server you want to connect. This creates a Server Instance — a project-scoped deployment of that server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure authentication">
    If the server requires authentication, set up an [Auth Link](/auth/auth-links) so that users (or a service account) can provide credentials for this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pause and unpause server instances

You can temporarily disable a Server Instance by **pausing** it. When paused:

- The server's tools are not exposed to agents in that project
- Existing credentials are preserved
- You can unpause at any time to restore access

This is useful for maintenance windows or temporarily restricting access to certain integrations.

## Build a server from an API spec

If you have an API that is not available as an MCP server, you can use **Server Foundry** to generate one from an OpenAPI specification. The AI-powered Designer Agent guides you through selecting endpoints, optimizing tool definitions, and deploying a production-ready MCP server.
