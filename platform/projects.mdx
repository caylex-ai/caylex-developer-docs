A Project is the primary organizational unit in Caylex. It represents a single deployment of your agent system — whether that's a deployment for a specific customer, a team, or an environment.

## What a project contains

Each project is a self-contained environment with:

- **Server Instances** — the MCP servers connected to this project, each with project-specific credentials
- **Agent Instances** — the agents deployed in this project, each with their own API keys and tool permissions
- **User Credentials** — authentication credentials for users who interact with agents in this project
- **API Keys** — keys used to authenticate agent instances with the Caylex proxy
- **Auth Links** — shareable links that allow users to authenticate with the project's servers

Projects provide **complete isolation**. Servers, agents, credentials, and analytics are all scoped to a single project. This means you can safely deploy the same agents and servers across different customers or teams without any cross-contamination.

## Create a project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Projects">
    In the Caylex dashboard, go to the **Projects** page from the sidebar navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Project">
    Click the **Create Project** button to open the creation form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your project">
    Provide the following details:

    - **Name** (required) — a descriptive name for the project (e.g., "Acme Corp Production", "Internal Team Dev")
    - **Description** (optional) — a brief description of the project's purpose
    - **Icon** (optional) — a visual identifier for the project

    <Check>
    Your project is created and ready for you to add servers and agents.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manage your project

Once created, your project dashboard shows:

- **Server Instances** — all connected servers and their status (active or paused)
- **Agent Instances** — all deployed agents with their configurations
- **Session Logs** — a filterable log of all sessions processed in this project
- **Auth Links** — links for user authentication
- **API Keys** — keys for agent authentication

## Webhooks

You can configure **webhooks** at the project level to receive real-time notifications about tool execution events. Webhooks fire for:

- `query.created` — when a new query is received
- `tool_call.completed` — when a tool call finishes successfully
- `tool_call.error` — when a tool call fails

Configure webhooks in your project settings by providing a webhook URL. Caylex signs all webhook payloads with HMAC for verification and supports Slack-formatted messages out of the box.

<Note>
Webhook notifications are not sent for playground sessions.

## When to create multiple projects

Common patterns for project organization:

| Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Per customer** | "Acme Corp", "Widget Inc" — each customer gets isolated servers and credentials |
| **Per team** | "Engineering", "Sales", "Support" — each team gets their own agent configurations |
| **Per environment** | "Development", "Staging", "Production" — separate credentials and permissions per environment |

<Tip>
Start with a single project for development and testing. As you scale, create additional projects to isolate different customers or teams.
