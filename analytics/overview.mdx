Caylex provides real-time analytics and detailed session logs for every interaction that passes through the proxy. Use these to monitor agent performance, debug issues, and understand how your tools are being used.

## Dashboard overview

The analytics dashboard is accessible from the main navigation in the Caylex platform. It provides a high-level view of your platform's activity with the following metrics:

### Key metrics

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sessions processed** | Total number of sessions (agent interactions) processed |
| **Tool calls** | Total number of individual tool calls executed |
| **Error rate** | Percentage of tool calls that resulted in errors |
| **Average latency** | Average time for the proxy to process a tool call |
| **Average runtime** | Average execution time of tool calls on external servers |
| **Active users** | Weekly active users (WAU) and monthly active users (MAU) |
| **Tool calls per session** | Average number of tool calls per session (indicates session complexity) |

All metrics include **period-over-period comparisons** — you can see how the current period compares to the previous one (e.g., this week vs last week) to identify trends.

### Time-series graphs

The dashboard includes interactive graphs for:

- **Sessions over time** — visualize session volume trends
- **Tool calls over time** — track tool execution volume
- **Error rate over time** — monitor error trends and spikes
- **Error types over time** — see the breakdown of error categories (authentication, rate limit, timeout, execution errors)
- **Latency over time** — track proxy processing time trends
- **Runtime over time** — monitor external server response times
- **Tool calls per session over time** — observe session complexity trends

<Tip>
Use the time window selector to view data over different periods: last hour, last day, last week, or last month. You can also adjust the aggregation frequency (per minute, hour, day, week, or month) for more or less granularity.
</Tip>

### Top tools and servers

The dashboard also shows:

- **Top tools** — the most frequently used tools, ranked by call count
- **Servers** — which servers are being accessed and how often
- **Agent-tool connections** — which agents are using which tools, visualized as a relationship map

## Filtering

All analytics can be filtered by:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Project** | Scope to a specific project |
| **Agent** | Scope to a specific agent instance |
| **Server** | Scope to a specific server instance |
| **User** | Scope to a specific user |
| **Time window** | Select the date range to analyze |

Combine filters to drill down into specific areas. For example, filter by a specific agent and server to see how that agent uses a particular integration.

## Session logs

Session logs provide a detailed view of every session processed by the proxy. Navigate to a project and open the **Session Logs** tab to see all sessions.

Each session log entry shows:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Session Summary** | The original query or intent that started the session |
| **Tool Calls** | Total number of tool calls executed in the session |
| **Errors** | Number of tool calls that failed |
| **Servers Invoked** | Icons showing which servers were accessed |
| **Agent** | Which agent instance processed the session |
| **User** | Which user triggered the session |
| **Timestamp** | When the session was received |

You can filter sessions by agent, server, and date range. Sort by newest or oldest first.

### Session details

Click on any session to open the **Session Details** drawer with three sections:

#### Session summary

The full text of the original query or intent.

#### Statistics

An overview of the session including the user, total tool calls, error count, timestamp, and which servers were invoked.

#### Tool trace

A visual timeline showing every tool call executed in the session, displayed as a vertical step-by-step trace. The trace shows:

- **Individual tool calls** — each displayed with the tool name, timestamp, and server icon
- **Parallel tool calls** — grouped together and labeled as "Parallel" with the number of tools executed simultaneously
- **Error indicators** — failed tool calls are highlighted with a red icon

For each tool call in the trace, you can see:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Tool** | The name of the tool that was called |
| **From Server** | Which server the tool belongs to |
| **Latency** | How long the call took |
| **Timestamp** | When the call was executed |

If a tool call failed, you can click **View Error Message** to see the full error details, including any contextual error recovery information with examples of previous successful calls to the same tool.

<Tip>
Session traces are invaluable for debugging. If an agent is not behaving as expected, the trace shows exactly which tools were called, on which servers, and in what order — making it easy to pinpoint where things went wrong.
</Tip>

## User analytics

Per-user analytics are available in the project's **Users** tab. For each user, you can see:

- **Activity timeline** — sessions and tool calls over time
- **Top tools** — the tools used most by this user's agent interactions
- **Top servers** — the servers accessed most on behalf of this user
- **Error rate** — the percentage of tool calls that failed for this user

See [Managing Users](/auth/managing-users) for more on the user view.

## Efficiency analytics

The agent instance analytics drawer includes two metrics that measure how effectively your agent uses the proxy's tool suggestion system. These appear under **Efficiency Analytics** on the agent instance's Analytics tab.

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Tool Discovery Efficiency** | The ratio of tool invocations to tool discovery operations (`suggest_tools` + `get_tool_schemas` calls). Higher values mean your agent is invoking more tools per discovery operation — indicating efficient tool selection with less overhead. |
| **Tool Suggestion Spread** | The ratio of tool invocations to the total number of suggested tools. Higher values mean a larger proportion of suggested tools are actually being invoked, indicating that the suggestions are relevant and high quality. |

These metrics are scoped to the selected time window (hour, day, week, or month) and are filtered by project and agent instance.

## Error monitoring

The error analytics section categorizes errors by type:

| Error type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | Credential issues — user not authenticated, expired tokens |
| **Rate limit** | External server rate limiting |
| **Timeout** | Tool call exceeded the configured timeout |
| **Execution** | Errors returned by the external MCP server |
| **Query** | Errors in the query processing itself |

Use error type trends to identify systemic issues. For example, a spike in authentication errors might indicate expired OAuth tokens that need renewal, while timeout errors might suggest a server performance problem.
