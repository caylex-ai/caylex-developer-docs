LinkedIn supports OAuth 2.0 for accessing its APIs. You create an application through the LinkedIn Developer Solutions portal to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

## Steps

1. **Create a LinkedIn Developer Application**
   - Go to [https://developer.linkedin.com](https://developer.linkedin.com)
   - Click **Create app**
   - Enter the required details:
     - **App name**
     - **Company page URL** (LinkedIn company page)
     - **App logo**
   - Read and agree to the legal terms
   - Click **Create App**

2. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - Navigate to the application you just created
   - Go to the **Auth** tab
   - Under **Application credentials**, find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Copy and save both values securely

3. **Configure the Redirect URI**
   - In the **Auth** tab, scroll to **OAuth 2.0 Settings** (below Application Credentials)
   - Add your OAuth callback URL

4. **Configure Scopes / Products**
   - LinkedIn scopes are tied to **Products** that you request access to
   - Go to the **Products** tab and request access to the products you need (e.g., Sign In with LinkedIn, Share on LinkedIn, Marketing Developer Platform)
   - Available scopes depend on which products are approved
