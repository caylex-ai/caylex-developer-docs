   - Go to [Your Integrations](https://www.canva.com/developers/integrations)
   - Click **Create an integration**
   - Choose integration type:
     - **Public Integration**: Available to all Canva users (requires Canva team approval)
     - **Private Integration**: Team-only access (requires Canva Enterprise Plan)

2. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - Navigate to your newly created integration
   - Under the **Configuration** tab → **Credentials**, find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Copy both values

3. **Configure the Redirect URI**
   - Go to the **Authentication** tab
   - Under **Authorized Redirects**, add your OAuth callback URL

4. **Configure Scopes**
   - Go to the **Scopes** tab
