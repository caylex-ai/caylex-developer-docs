Zoom supports OAuth 2.0 for integrating with its meeting, webinar, and team chat APIs. You create an app through the Zoom Marketplace developer portal.

## Steps

1. **Create an Application**
   - Go to the [Zoom App Creation Portal](https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create)
   - Create a **General** application (or **Server-to-Server** depending on use case)

2. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - Navigate to your newly created application
   - Under the **Basic Information** tab → **App Credentials**, find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Optionally configure app details (name, developer info) for Development and Production environments separately

3. **Configure the Redirect URI**
   - In the **OAuth Information** section (below the credentials), add your OAuth callback URL

4. **Configure Scopes**
   - Go to the **Scopes** tab under **Build your app**
   - Click **+ Add Scopes** to see available products and their scopes
   - Select the scopes your integration needs (e.g., team chat, meetings, webinars)
   - Zoom does not enable any scopes by default — you must add them manually
