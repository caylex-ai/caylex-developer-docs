HubSpot is a CRM and marketing platform that supports OAuth 2.0 for secure API access. You need a **developer account** and a **public app** to obtain OAuth credentials.

## Steps

1. **Create a HubSpot Developer Account**
   - Go to [https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)
   - Sign up for a developer account (required for creating public apps)

2. **Create a Public App**
   - In your developer account, navigate to **Apps** in the main navigation bar
   - Click **Create App** in the top-right corner
   - Enter app details: name, description, logo, and support information
   - These details are shown to users during the OAuth consent flow

3. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - In your app settings, click the **Auth** tab
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed on this page

4. **Configure the Redirect URI**
   - In the Auth tab, scroll to the **Redirect URLs** section (below the credentials)
   - Add your application's OAuth callback URL

5. **Configure Scopes**
   - Still in the Auth tab, select the scopes your integration needs
   - HubSpot scopes are granular and tied to specific API endpoints
