Airtable is a cloud-based database/spreadsheet platform that supports OAuth 2.0 for secure API access. You create an OAuth integration through the Airtable Developer Portal.

## Steps

1. **Access the Developer Portal**
   - Go to [https://airtable.com/developers/web/api](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api)
   - Sign in with your Airtable account

2. **Create an OAuth Integration**
   - In the left-hand menu, click **OAuth integrations** (in the Guide section)
   - Click **+ New OAuth Integration** in the top-right corner
   - Fill in the app details: name, description (website is optional)

3. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - After saving, Airtable will display the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Copy both values and store them securely

4. **Configure the Redirect URI**
   - In the Redirect URLs section of your OAuth app, add your callback URL
   - Ensure there is no trailing slash and the protocol is `https`

5. **Configure Scopes**
   - Airtable provides granular scopes for different data access levels
   - Select the scopes that match your integration needs during the OAuth flow
