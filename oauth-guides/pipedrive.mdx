Pipedrive is a sales CRM that supports OAuth 2.0 for API integrations. You create applications through the Pipedrive Developer Hub, with options for public or private apps.

## Steps

1. **Create a Pipedrive Application**
   - Go to the [Pipedrive Developer Hub](https://app.pipedrive.com/developer-hub) (use a developer sandbox account)
   - Click **Create an app**
   - Choose the app type:
     - **Public Application**: Available to all Pipedrive users (requires review/approval)
     - **Private Application**: Only for selected users (no review needed)

2. **Configure Basic Info**
   - Go to the **Basic Info** tab
   - Fill in:
     - **App name** (must be unique for public apps)
     - **Callback URL**: Your OAuth callback URL
   - Click **Save**

3. **Get OAuth Credentials**
   - Go to the **OAuth and access scopes** tab
   - Scroll down to find:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
   - Copy both values

4. **Configure Scopes**
   - In the same **OAuth and access scopes** tab, find the **Access Scopes** section
   - By default, Pipedrive only provides basic read access
   - Select scopes with either **Read only** or **Full access** for each resource:
     - Contacts, Leads, Mail, Activities, Products, Projects
   - Common full-access scopes: `contacts:full`, `leads:full`, `mail:full`, `activities:full`, `products:full`, `projects:full`

5. **Submit for Review** (public apps only)
   - Go to the **App review info** tab and submit for review
   - Private applications don't require review
