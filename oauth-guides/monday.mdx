Monday.com is a work management platform that supports OAuth 2.0 for API integrations. Apps are created through the Monday.com Developer Console.

## Steps

1. **Create a Monday.com Developer App**
   - Go to [https://monday.com/developers/apps](https://monday.com/developers/apps)
   - Log in with your Monday.com account
   - Click **Create App** in the developer console

2. **Configure the App**
   - Give your app a name (e.g., `My Monday Integration`)
   - Monday.com will automatically generate:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
     - **Signing Secret**
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret immediately

3. **Set the Redirect URI**
   - In the app settings, find the **Redirect URLs** section
   - Add your OAuth callback URL
   - Ensure no trailing slash and `https` protocol

4. **Configure OAuth Scopes**
   - Monday.com requires you to specify scopes for API access
   - Common scopes:
     - `boards:read` / `boards:write` — Board data
     - `workspaces:read` / `workspaces:write` — Workspace info
     - `users:read` / `users:write` — User data
     - `me:read` — Current user info
     - `updates:read` / `updates:write` — Updates/comments
     - `docs:read` / `docs:write` — Documents
     - `tags:read` — Tags
     - `teams:read` / `teams:write` — Teams
     - `notifications:write` — Send notifications
