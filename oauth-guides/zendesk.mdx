Zendesk supports OAuth 2.0 for secure access to its support, ticketing, and customer service APIs. OAuth clients are created through the Zendesk Admin Center.

## Steps

1. **Log in to Zendesk Admin Center**
   - In the left sidebar, click **Apps and integrations**
   - Select **APIs**
   - Open the **OAuth clients** tab

2. **Create an OAuth Client**
   - Click **Add OAuth client**
   - Fill in:
     - **Client Name**: e.g., `My Integration`
     - **Description**: (optional)
     - **Redirect URLs**: Your OAuth callback URL

3. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**
   - After saving, Zendesk will generate:
     - **Client ID (Identifier)**
     - **Client Secret**
   - Copy and store them securely

4. **Configure Redirect URI**
   - Ensure your callback URL is listed in the OAuth client settings
   - No trailing slash, must use `https`

5. **Understanding Scopes**
   - Zendesk does **not** provide a UI to configure scopes in the Admin Center
   - Scopes are **requested at authorization time** as part of the OAuth flow
   - Zendesk supports these OAuth scopes:
     - `read` — Read access to Zendesk resources
     - `write` — Create and update resources
     - `delete` — Delete resources
   - Permissions are also constrained by the user's role (agent, admin, etc.)
