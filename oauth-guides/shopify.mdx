Shopify supports OAuth 2.0 for custom app integrations. Apps are created through the Shopify Admin Dashboard and the Dev Dashboard, giving you a Client ID and Client Secret.

## Steps

1. **Create a Shopify Account** (if needed)
   - Go to [https://www.shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com) and start a free trial or log in

2. **Access the App Development Dashboard**
   - Log in to your Shopify Admin Dashboard
   - Search for **App Development** in the search bar
   - On the development page, click **Build apps in Dev Dashboard** to open the dedicated development environment

3. **Create Your App**
   - In the Dev Dashboard, click **Create App** in the top-right corner
   - Enter a descriptive **App Name** and click **Create**

4. **Configure App Settings**
   - On the version configuration page, set:
     - **App URL**: Your application's main URL
     - **Scope Selections**: Choose API scopes based on your needs
       - Essential: `read_orders`, `write_orders`, `read_products`, `write_products`
       - Additional: `read_customers`, `write_customers`, `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
     - **Redirect URL**: Your OAuth callback URL
   - Click **Release** to finalize the app version

5. **Get OAuth Credentials**
   - Navigate to the **Settings** page from the left sidebar
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Keep the Client Secret secure
