This guide walks you through setting up your first project, connecting a server, creating an agent, and running your first query — all in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Caylex account ([sign up at app.caylex.ai](https://app.caylex.ai))
- Python 3.10+ installed
- An MCP server to connect (or use one from the Caylex Catalog)

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    In the Caylex dashboard, navigate to **Projects** and click **Create Project**. Give it a name (e.g., "My First Project") and an optional description.

    A project is an isolation boundary for your deployment — it contains its own servers, agents, and user credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a server from the catalog">
    Go to the **Servers** page and click **Add Server**. Browse the Caylex Catalog and select a server to add (e.g., GitHub, Slack, or Notion).

    Once added, go to your project and connect the server by adding it as a **Server Instance**. This links the server to your project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an agent">
    Navigate to the **Agents** page and click **Create Agent**. Provide a name and description for your agent (e.g., "My Assistant").

    Then connect the agent to your project — this creates an **Agent Instance**. On the agent instance page, click **Create API Key** and copy the generated key. You will need this to authenticate your agent with the proxy.

    <Warning>
    Store your API key securely. It is only shown once at creation time.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up user authentication">
    If your server requires authentication (most do), create an **Auth Link** for your project. Go to the project's **Auth Links** section and create a new link. Visit the link yourself to authenticate with the server using your credentials.

    See [Auth Links](/auth/auth-links) for a detailed guide.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your agent">
    Install your preferred agent framework and connect to Caylex. Here is an example using the OpenAI Agents SDK:

    ```bash
    pip install openai-agents
    ```

    ```python main.py
    import asyncio
    import os

    from agents import Agent, Runner
    from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

    async def main() -> None:
        api_key = os.environ["CAYLEX_API_KEY"]
        user_email = os.environ["CAYLEX_USER_EMAIL"]

        async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
            name="Caylex",
            params={
                "url": "https://proxy.caylex.ai/mcp",
                "headers": {
                    "x-api-key": api_key,
                    "x-user-email": user_email,
                },
            },
        ) as server:
            agent = Agent(
                name="Assistant",
                model="gpt-5.2",
                instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can access external systems using Caylex.",
                mcp_servers=[server],
            )

            result = await Runner.run(agent, "What tools do you have access to?")
            print(result.final_output)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    Set the environment variables and run:

    ```bash
    export CAYLEX_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    export CAYLEX_USER_EMAIL="you@example.com"
    python main.py
    ```

    <Check>
    Your agent should discover all available tools from the servers connected to your project and list them.
    </Check>
