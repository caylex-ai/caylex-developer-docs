description: "Empower your AI agents to skillfully interact with any external system through a single MCP interface."

Caylex provides an **MCP Proxy** that connects your AI agents to hundreds of external platforms through a single interface. Connect to pre-built servers from the Caylex Catalog, or build custom integrations with Server Foundry. Your agents gain the ability to skillfully navigate their entire information network — all from one MCP connection.

On the Caylex platform, you can inspect granular tool traces, monitor tool-use analytics, and manage tool authorizations — all in one place.

## What Caylex provides

- **Unified access** — A single MCP connection point for all your servers. Your agent connects once to Caylex and gets access to every tool across every connected server.
- **Auth and permissions** — User-level authentication for external services and agent-level tool restrictions for fine-grained access control.
- **Intelligent tool navigation** — Dynamic tool suggestions so agents reliably choose the right actions, and Context Maps so agents understand where information lives across your connected systems.
- **Usage analytics** — Track tool usage, performance, error rates, and user activity across your entire agent deployment.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your MCP servers">
    Add servers from the Caylex Catalog (GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion, and more) or bring your own custom MCP servers. Use Server Foundry to build new servers from any OpenAPI spec.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create projects">
    Organize your deployments into projects — one per customer, team, or environment. Each project has its own server instances, agent instances, and user credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure agents">
    Create agents and configure which tools and servers each agent can access. Generate API keys for programmatic access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate with your agent framework">
    Connect Caylex to your AI agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain, Claude Agent SDK, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible framework.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your agents navigate all connected systems">
    Your agents discover and use tools across all connected servers through Caylex's unified proxy — with automatic authentication, intelligent tool suggestions, and full observability.
  </Step>
</Steps>
